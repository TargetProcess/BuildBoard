# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.

# Router 
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point. 
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly. 
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~ 
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# Root logger:
logger.root = ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:

# replicassafe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; waits for at least 2 servers for the write operation.

# Replica sets
# ~~~~~
# http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Why+Replica+Sets
